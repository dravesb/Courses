### Exercise 2.4

```{r}
#take a peak at the data 
head(iris)

#Take a look at multiple bandwidths 
par(mfrow = c(3,3))
for(h in seq(.1, .8, .1)){
  plot(density(iris$Petal.Length, bw = h, kernel = "gaussian"), xlab ="", ylab = "Petal Length", main = paste("Bandwidth: ",h))
}

#Take a look at multiple kerenels
kernels = c("gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular","triangular", "biweight","cosine", "optcosine")

par(mfrow = c(3,3))
for(kern in kernels){
  plot(density(iris$Petal.Length, bw =0.2 , kernel = kern), xlab ="", ylab = "Petal Length", main = paste("Kernel: ",kern))
}



```
