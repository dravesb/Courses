GLM Project Goal: 
	- Model the number of tracks in this network as a function of 
		- Mouse gender 	
		- Region attributes (encoded as factors)
	- Question: how does the number of voxels affect the number of pairings

C57Y Set 
- Each network In C57 
	- Adjacency matrix corresponds to the number between regions 
	- Where track "paths through three dimensional space"
	- What travels on those tracks are axons - brain wave stuff 
- Each network in a Matlab file 
	- 10 brains for each mouse in the sample 
- Conn Adj 	
	- the log the number of tracks from a single brain 
	- Just use this to adapt code 
- Nii files 
	- shows you the region for each mouse 
	- add one thousand to get from left to right hemisphere 

Next Steps 
	- Build adjacency matrices for each mouse 
	- Build different types of covariate structures for each mouse 
	- write up some of the basic background stuff
