### Exercise 4.1 
Here, we build a weighted regression model for third quartile of full professor salaries on years of experience. The weights correspond to $w_i =  1/n_i$ where the $n_i$ correspond to the number of professors sampled for each fixed years of experience value. We fit the model below. 


```{r}
#read in data
dat = read.table("~/Desktop/Courses/MA 575/book_data/ProfessorSalaries.txt", header = T)

#take a peak 
head(dat)

#look at the bivariate relationship
plot(dat$Experience, dat$ThirdQuartile, main = "", pch = 2, col = "blue", xlab = "Yrs. Experience", ylab = "Third Quartile")

#Define weights for WLS 
w = dat$SampleSize

#Build WLS
wlm = lm(ThirdQuartile~Experience, data = dat, weights = w)

#check out fit 
plot(dat$Experience, dat$ThirdQuartile, main = "", pch = 2, col = "blue", xlab = "Yrs. Experience", ylab = "Third Quartile")
abline(wlm, col = "red")

#get fit statistics
summary(wlm)

```

Hence, the expected third quartile salary of a sixth year full professor is given by $104,759.0 + 1172.5x^{*} =104,759.0 + 1172.5(6)= \$111,794$.
